    <h1>Europe</h1>

    <p>
        Europe is the world's second-smallest continent by surface area, covering about 10,180,000 squarekilometers 
        (3,930,000 sq mi) or 2% of the Earth's surface and about 6.8% of its land area. Of Europe's approximately 50 countries, Russia is by far the largest by both area and population, taking up 40% of the continent 
        (although the country has territory in both Europe and Asia), while Vatican City is the smallest. Europe is the third-most populor continent after Asia and Africa, with a population of 739-743 million 
        or about 11% of the world's population.
